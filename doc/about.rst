About this repository
=====================

I created this repository to use in my demo for the 2022 ilionx Data Days. With it I try to demonstrate the
pitfalls of using Databricks in production environments and share some of my ideas about best-practices.

There are some notebook examples that can be imported into Databricks either via the workspace or databricks-cli.

The `databripy` package is meant as an example on how to organise your code into a package. It is not useful for
anything other than the demo and it only includes very basic operations. There are also some unit tests, but these
are far from complete. They only serve as an example.
